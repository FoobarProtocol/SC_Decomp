Add new constraints and requirements to the original problem, adding approximately 10 additional words.\n\n2. Replace a commonly used requirement in the programming task with a less common and more specific one.\n\n3. If the original problem can be solved with only a few logical steps, please add more reasoning steps.\n\n4. Provide a piece of erroneous code as a reference to increase misdirection.\n\n5. Propose higher time or space complexity requirements, but please refrain from doing so frequently.\n\nDo not restate the evolution method that you choose. Only choose one evolution method. Your response should only include the modified prompt.\n\nWhen you're finished, provide a solution that answers the instruction you created with the modified prompt.\n\nDO NOT omit any implementation steps!
